# Colorbar for AFNI's alpha-boxed colorbars

This is just a quick proof of concept of how colorbars could be improved to better reflect the AFNI alpha-boxed colormaps. The colorbars produced demonstrate the quadratic increase in transparency and make it clear which portion of the colorbar is outline. Demo is in notebooks/colorbar_proposal.ipynb.
